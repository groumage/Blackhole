Cryptology end-of-study internship
==================================

This github repo contains the work I have done during my end-of-study internship. It is about cryptology and more precisely develop and implement a proof of concept of a mecanism to improve the security of Parsec, a dropbox could-based.

The objective is to use a blockchain to implement a verifiable history of the metadata of encrypted blocks. In otger words, we consider that the backend switch from honest-but-curious to malicious. Throught two iteration, I manage to implement this proof-of-concept (check branch parsec-with-blockchain and parsec-with-ghost-blockchain to read more about those two iterations). My implementation is validated by the success of unit test already present in Parsec. In other words, I succesfully integrate a verifiable history in Parsec without arise problem with already implemented source code.


Finally, I have obtained the mark 18/20 at the defense of this project.

Result have been published on Scille's website, the company that develop and maintain Parsec: ``https://parsec.cloud/en/la-blockchain-au-service-du-stockage-cloud-securise``
